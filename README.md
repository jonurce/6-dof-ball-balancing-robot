# 6 Degree-of-Freedom Ball Balancing Robot   

## Overview
This repository shows the building process of a 6 degree-of-freedom ball balancing robot. It can be used as a learning project for robotics students, as it was used for Master students in Mechatronics and Automation at NTNU, Ålesund.

## Repository Description

The repository is divided as follows:

```     
├── Arduino Code                                            # Arduino code, including the solved and not-solved versions 
├── Arduino libraries                                       # Manually installed Arduino libraries  
├── CAD files                                               # 3D files in STL format, ready for 3D printing
├── Lasercuted files                                        # Drawings for lasercuting components
├── 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Guide.pdf                  # Step by step guide to build the platform
├── 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Inverse Kinematics.pdf     # Inverse Kinematics solution explanation
└── List of Materials.xlsx                                  # Component list with links
```

## Project for students

If using this repository as a project for students, it is proposed to not provide the inverse kinematics solution `6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Inverse Kinematics.pdf` neither the solved arduino code `Arduino Code/Arduino_Code_Solved` In the addition, the document `6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Guide.pdf` was explicitly made for students to follow.
