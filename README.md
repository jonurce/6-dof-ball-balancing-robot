# 6 Degree-of-Freedom Ball Balancing Robot 

**This project was developed as part of the course MMA4004 Mechatronics and Systems Integrations at NTNU, Ålesund**

**It was also done as a part time job, which focused on creating a reproducible project for robotics students at NTNU**

## Overview
This repository shows the building process of a 6 degree-of-freedom ball balancing robot. It can be used as a learning project for robotics students, as it was used for Master students in Mechatronics and Automation at NTNU, Ålesund.

## Repository Description

The repository is divided as follows:

```     
├── Arduino Code                                            # Arduino code, including the solved and not-solved versions 
├── Arduino libraries                                       # Manually installed Arduino libraries  
├── CAD files                                               # 3D files in STL format, ready for 3D printing
├── Lasercuted files                                        # Drawings for lasercuting components
├── Final Version                                           # Final version of the project for the course MMA4004
├── 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Guide.pdf                  # Step by step guide to build the platform
├── 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Inverse Kinematics.pdf     # Inverse Kinematics solution explanation
└── List of Materials.xlsx                                  # Component list with links
```

## Project for students

If using this repository as a project for students, it is proposed to not provide the inverse kinematics solution `6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Inverse Kinematics.pdf` neither the solved arduino code `Arduino Code/Arduino_Code_Solved` nor the final version `Final Version`. In addition, the document `6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot - Guide.pdf` was explicitly made for students to follow.

## Final version of the project for MMA4004

The final version presented for the course is available at the folder `Final Version`, which is distributed as follows:

```     
├── Final Version                                           
    ├── Code                                            # Final code
    ├── CAD_files.zip                                   # CAD files including first and second version STL files for 3D printing and drawings for lasercuting
    └── Final Report - 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot.pdf   # Final project report
```

The final project report `Final Version/Final Report - 6 DOF Ball Balancing Robot.pdf` explains all the implemented features in detail, as well as the obtained results.

The final code is explained in details at Modesta's repository: https://github.com/ModeS7/MMA4004-stewart.git
